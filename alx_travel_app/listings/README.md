# ALX Travel App — API Development for Listings and Bookings

## 📌 Overview
This project enhances the **alx_travel_app** by implementing full CRUD API endpoints for managing **Listings** and **Bookings** using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. Each endpoint is documented with **Swagger**, enabling interactive testing and clear API exploration.  
The goal is to follow RESTful best practices while ensuring that all endpoints are functional, cleanly structured, and easy to test.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Implement **ViewSets** in DRF to handle CRUD operations efficiently.
- Configure API endpoints using **DRF Routers**.
- Apply **RESTful conventions** in API design.
- Integrate **Swagger (drf-yasg)** for interactive documentation.
- Test all API endpoints using tools like **Postman**.

---

## 🏆 Learning Outcomes
Learners will be able to:

- Develop CRUD endpoints for multiple database models.
- Integrate automatic API documentation into Django.
- Deploy RESTful API endpoints that follow best practices.
- Test both successful and error-case scenarios using Postman or Curl.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### CRUD Operations
Create, Read, Update, and Delete API functionality for resources such as listings and bookings.

### ModelViewSet
A DRF class that auto-generates all CRUD actions with minimal code.

### DRF Routers
Automatic URL mapping for ViewSets without writing standard `path()` entries.

### Swagger API Documentation
Interactive docs generated using **drf-yasg**, accessible via a `/swagger/` endpoint.

### API Testing
Validating endpoint behavior with Postman or Curl to ensure correctness and reliability.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Django** – Python web framework
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – API development toolkit
- **drf-yasg** – Swagger API documentation generator
- **SQLite / PostgreSQL** – Database backend
- **Postman** – For endpoint testing

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case
This project reflects the backend design used by travel platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia).  
Such systems must support:

- Property listings  
- Booking operations  
- High-quality API documentation  
- Reliable CRUD operations  

Swagger documentation and DRF ViewSets help create scalable and testable backend services.
